# Research Log Structure

This log is designed to do **three jobs at once**:

It is **append-only**. You never delete entries. Dead ideas are assets.

---

## How Many Logs You Should Have

Use **three simple files** (or notebooks). Do not overcomplicate this.

1. `hypothesis_log.md`
2. `experiment_log.md`
3. `regime_journal.md`

You will touch **#1 every day**, **#2 most days**, and **#3 a few times per week**.

---

# 1. Hypothesis Log (Primary Log)

This is the most important file.

Each entry is **one hypothesis**, even if you never test it.

---

## Hypothesis Entry Template

```
ID:
Date:
Market / Instrument:

Raw Question:

Actor:
Constraint:
Mechanism:
Persistence:
Kill Condition:

Primary Prediction:
Secondary Predictions:

Confidence (0–100%):
Status: [Untested | Testing | Weak Evidence | Rejected | Promising]

Notes:
```

---

### Rules

* One idea per entry
* Write the *raw question* exactly as it occurred
* Fill in every field, even if it feels forced
* Update **Status**, never rewrite history

---

### Why This Matters

* Interviewers love seeing how your thinking evolved
* “Rejected” ideas demonstrate judgment
* Confidence scores show calibration over time

---

# 2. Experiment Log (Evidence Log)

This is where tests live. It links back to hypotheses.

Think of this as **lab notes**, not polished research.

---

## Experiment Entry Template

```
Experiment ID:
Linked Hypothesis ID:
Date:

Test Description:

Data:
Time Period:

Method:

Key Results:

What Failed:
What Held Up:

Suspicious Artifacts:

Decision:
```

---

### Decision Options

* Proceed
* Modify hypothesis
* Add constraint
* Kill idea

Write one sentence explaining why.

---

# 3. Regime Journal (State Awareness Log)

This log trains **macro and structural awareness**.

Entries are less frequent but deeper.

---

## Regime Entry Template

```
Date:
Regime Description:

What Changed:

Who Was Forced to Act:

Strategies That Benefited:
Strategies That Failed:

Early Warning Indicators:

How This Affects My Hypotheses:
```

---

### Example Regimes

* Post-2020 retail options flow
* Post-2022 rate regime
* Volatility control fund deleveraging

---

# How This Fits Your Daily Loop

* **Daily:** Add or update one hypothesis
* **During failure analysis:** Add an experiment entry
* **Weekly:** Add or update one regime entry

---

# Interview Payoff (Why This Is Worth It)

From these logs, you can easily answer:

* “Tell me about a strategy that didn’t work”
* “How do you decide when to stop researching something?”
* “How do you think about regime changes?”

You will not need to invent stories. You will have receipts.

---

## Hard Rules (Do Not Skip These)

* Never delete an entry
* Never backfill with hindsight
* Never hide failed ideas

Your future self (and interviewers) will thank you.
